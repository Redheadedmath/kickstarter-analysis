# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
***Overview*** <br />
Analyzing kickstarter data for trends, particularly those in the theatre genre. 
Prominent analysis focuses on the trends of Kickstarter Campaign Goals and Pledges among successful and failed campaigns. 
This is to inform client Louis's decision of starting her own Kickstarter campaign by highlighting relevant factors of the more successful Kickstarter Theatre and Musical Campaigns.  <br />  <br />
***Report*** <br />
An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns is not only optimistic regarding theatre campaigns compared to other genres of campaigns, but illuminates multiple key factors that distinguish successful campaigns from their failed counterparts. These graphs demonstrate the relatively high number of theatre campaigns compared to other genres and show the majority of these theatre campaigns are indeed successful. <br />

More specifically, the month in which a campaign was launched tended to be a strong indicator for its potential success. As depicted, the majority of successful theatre campaigns were launched in the summer months--June in particular. <br />

***Descriptive Statistics*** <br />

The scope of Louise's anticipated campaign amount is $4000. The descriptive statistics show that successful US Theatre campaigns tend to have smaller goals. A campaign of $4000 fits nicely into the middle 50% of successful campaigns, slightly above median. The boxplots illustrate the shape, center and spread of the Goals and Pledges for this genre which suggest that we would anticipatet that, all else the same, Louise's campaign is likely to be successful and have many small pledges.
