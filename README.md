**Indicators of Success** <br />
Beyond the general success of this subgenre of Kickstarter campaigns, there emerged two key indicators for success among other similar campaigns: Launch date, and Goal amount. <br />
It is clear that Summer time launch dates tended to bode very well compared to the rest of the year--particularly June. The visualization below shows this trend while backing up the claim that this subgenre is particularly successful as there are more successful than failed campaigns at all times through the year. <br />
